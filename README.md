# CLASSLIB
Unicode version of  Charles C. Sims' CLASSLIB used in Abstract Algebra-A Computational Approach

See https://comp.lang.apl.narkive.com/bA8Q62IO/archive-for-charles-c-sims-classlib

CLASSLIB is a libaray provides APL procedures that enables the ability doing
multiple percision and symbolic computations, comparable to CAS programs such
as MACSYMA of MacLisp.

# Project goal(s)
Create an archive for CLASSLIB in a implementation independent format that should
take trvival efforts to port to any APL2 compatible implementations.

# TODO list

- [ ] convert to unicode
- [ ] write documentation
- [ ] implement `SHOW` function as described in *Computational Algebra with APL*.
